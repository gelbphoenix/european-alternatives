## black.com (Email Provider)

**Proposed in:** PR #91 (2026-02-16)
**Claimed origin:** Vienna, Austria
**Category:** Email

### Reason for Denial

The sole owner and developer, Patrick Brunner, has a documented SEC and CFTC enforcement history. Brunner was CEO and sole owner of 1pool Ltd. (a.k.a. 1Broker), a Marshall Islands-registered bitcoin derivatives platform that was charged in September 2018 with illegally offering securities-based swaps and failing to implement anti-money laundering procedures. The FBI seized the 1broker.com domain, and the total settlement was approximately $990,000.

Beyond the founder's background, black.com fails multiple trust and transparency criteria:

- **Proprietary and closed-source** — encryption claims cannot be independently verified
- **No independent security audit** published
- **One-person operation** with no team transparency (bus factor of 1)
- **No PGP support**
- **AI features** integrated into email contradict genuine privacy commitment
- **Missing legally required Austrian Impressum** on website
- **Privacy Guides explicitly refuses to recommend it**, calling it "proprietary trash"

## Cryptostorm (VPN)

**Proposed in:** PR #91 (2026-02-16)
**Claimed origin:** Iceland
**Actual origin:** Vancouver, Canada (Baneki Privacy Computing Inc.)
**Category:** VPN

### Reason for Denial

Cryptostorm is **not a European company**. Despite using an Icelandic TLD (.is) and claiming "Icelandic roots," the registered corporate entity is Baneki Privacy Computing Inc., based in Vancouver, Canada — a Five Eyes alliance member. When asked about jurisdiction, a Cryptostorm spokesperson responded: "Which country are you based in from a legal perspective? Iceland, actually we don't care."

Beyond the false European claim, Cryptostorm has severe trust concerns:

- **Founder Douglas Spink** was convicted in 2005 of smuggling 375 pounds of cocaine ($34 million value) and sentenced to 17 years in prison
- Spink was **released after only 3 years** due to "extensive cooperation with investigators," fueling widespread honeypot/law-enforcement-collaboration suspicions
- **Removed from privacytools.io** (GitHub issue #1098) specifically due to founder trust concerns
- **Not recommended by Privacy Guides**
- Current operators are **pseudo-anonymous** with no accountability
- **Five Eyes jurisdiction** (Canada) undermines any privacy claims
